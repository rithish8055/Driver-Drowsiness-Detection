# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Led the development of an innovative IoTbasedsystem to detect driver drowsiness. Utilized technologies such as
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Arduino and
Python. The system enhances road safety by alerting drivers with a beep
sound if their eyes remain closed for more than three seconds.
